## Active Context â€“ Tenmo

### Current Focus
- Establish Memory Bank per `ai_instructions.md` to persist project understanding across sessions.
- Use Memory Bank files as the single source of truth for overview and conventions.

### Recent Changes
- Added `memory-bank/*` (projectbrief, product-context, system-patterns, tech-context, active-context, progress).
- Absorbed prior temporary overview into Memory Bank; removed external references.

### Next Steps
- Keep Memory Bank updated after notable code or behavior changes.
- If adding providers/models or changing prompts, update `tech-context.md` and `system-patterns.md`.

### Important Preferences
- Prefer Tailwind animation utilities over custom CSS files for animations.
- Use Artifacts for substantial content; do not update immediately after creation without user request.
